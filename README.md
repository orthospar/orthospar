Hi! I’m Dr Jason Bennett, and I am currently at the University of Western Australia.

Research Areas:
- 💎 mineralogy
- 🧪 geochemistry
- 🔬 petrology
- ⚒ ore deposit geology

I am currently working on:
- Sn mineral systems (and related critical metals such as W, Nb, Ta, Li, etc) 
  - Cassiterite Geochemistry
  - Genesis and evolution of Sn-mineralising fluids 
  - Targeting and vectoring towards new deposits of critical metals
  
- Translithospheric transport of S and chalcophile elements
  -  Experimental petrology on S solubility

- Fluid Inclusion Microthermometry
  - Physicochemical properties of ore forming fluids
